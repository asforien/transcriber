						<b>PROJECT TITLE</b>
						<p>Multilingual Speech Recognition</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH STUDY</b>
						<p>The goal of this research is to train automatic speech recognition software in many languages. Speech recognition works best if provided with training data: audio clips, each of which has been transcribed by some listeners.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>PARTICIPATION ELIGIBILITY & DURATION</b>
						<p>We ask that you participate in this study only if you are a native speaker of the language in which the task instructions are written, and only if you are at least 18 years old for non-Singaporeans and 21 years old for Singaporeans.  You will be allowed to continue participating as often as you wish, for whatever period of time you wish: there is no minimum or maximum period of participation.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS</b>
						<p>We expect that as many as 1000 people may take part in this research.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>PROCEDURE</b>
						<p>You will work from home, using your own computer.  You will be asked to access a web page, containing the audio data you are to transcribe.  You will be permitted to play each audio sample as often as you like, then they will be asked to provide one of two different types of transcription: (1) For some types of audio clips, you will simply be asked to type what they hear, using any keyboard that is convenient to you. (2) For other types of audio clips, you will be given a series of menus.  Each menu will be time-aligned to a segment of the audio clip, using a visual display of the waveform.  Each menu will list features that the audio might have, for example, consonant versus vowel, or high tone versus low tone.  You will be asked to choose, from each menu, the feature that best matches its time-aligned section of the audio clip.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>CONFIDENTIALITY</b>
						<p>Your name and email are requested to automatically send this Participation Information Sheet to you so you get an electronic copy of this document. Your name and email information will be encrypted before it gets transmitted back to the online server. Your name and email will remain encrypted throughout the study and will be deleted after the study. Since all of this is handled automatically, your identity will remain anonymous.</p>

						<p>If you are one of the pilot subjects for testing out the usability of the response collection web system, you might receive an automatic email sent from the web server to ask you if you are interested in helping the researchers improve the web interface design by corresponding with the researchers through email, phone or in person. You are not required to respond to such a request. If you are willing to respond, you can choose to respond using a pseudo name and/or secondary email to remain anonymous.</p>

						<p>Your transcriptions will be published as part of a database of speech transcriptions we are creating; no information about you will be published with the transcriptions.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>RISKS/DISCOMFORTS</b>
						<p>Participation in this research has no risks other than the ordinary risks of using a personal computer.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>COMPENSATION FOR INJURIES</b>
						<p>No injuries and no adverse reactions are anticipated from these studies.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>REIMBURSEMENT</b>
						<p>You will receive SGD$10 for your participation.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
					<b>BENEFITS</b>
					<p>There is no direct benefit to you by participating in this research. The knowledge gained will benefit the public in the future in areas such as second language learning, spoken language processing, healthcare services to assist the elderly.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
					<b>WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPATION</b>
					<p>Your decision to participate in this research is voluntary and completely up to you. You can also withdraw from the research at any time without giving any reasons. Since your identity will remain anonymous to the researchers and only tasks that are completed are saved, your decision of withdrawal will also remain anonymous to the researchers.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
					<b>CONTACT INFORMATION</b>
					<p>Please contact the Principal Investigator, Nancy Chen (nfychen@i2r.a-star.edu.sg), for all research-related matters.</p>
